# Welcome to List Of Posts ðŸ‘‹

This project displays a list of patient posts that share their assessment for a health concern they had. The posts can be filtered by gender and age group, and expanded to read the full post and comments.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
